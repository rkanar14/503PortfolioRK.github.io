<font size="6"> This is a Data Visualization Portfolio that includes Assignments and a Flexdashboard as a Final Project. 
Below is a description for the assignments and the Flexdashboard I worked on.

* Assignment 6: Geospatial Visualizations
In this assignment I had to visualize historical US election data and unemployment rates across US counties using choropleths. I created three 3x2 panels of choropleths, one each for Texas, California and Pennsylvania. The rows corresponded to the years 2008, 2012 and 2016, and the columns corresponded to the percent of the vote received either the Democratic or Republican candidate for president, and the unemployment rate in that year. I am adding the link to github repo for this one because the file is very large: https://github.com/anly503/anly503-fall2020-a6-rkanar14. Please refer to the second branch for the Rmd File.

* Assignment 7: Network Graph
Included information about the flow of people between different states in the United States over the period of one year, using network graphs.I picked New York, Texas, California, and Pennsylvania as my primary states. This visualization showed graphically the relative numbers of people that moved to the top 10 destination states from each of the origin states.

* Final Project: World University Ranking Visualizations
This is a Flexdashboard. The data used included University names, their location, world rank total score and other variables. Through my visualizations, I aim to create a strong base of comprehension for prospective student. Being an individual who had to apply and short list schools, I can understand how overwhelming it can get. I hope through this project it can steer a prospective student in the right direction. </font>
